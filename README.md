# SeatReservations
In order for to have a family, 4 people need to sit next to each other
in a row. If two people are seperated by an aisle (Between C and D,
G and H), they are considered not sitting and thus can't be part of
the same family unless two people of the family sit on the left side
of an aisle and the other two on the right side.
